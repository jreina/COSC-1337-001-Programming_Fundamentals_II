For the string "hello world":

TOP OF LOOP
s=[he]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[el]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[ll]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[lo]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[o ]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[ w]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[wo]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[or]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[rl]
TOP OF LOOP
s=[ld]


Then break that 2 character long string into two 1 character long strings:

TOP OF LOOP
c1 = h
c2 = e
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = e
c2 = l
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = l
c2 = l
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = l
c2 = o
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = o
c2 = 
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = 
c2 = w
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = w
c2 = o
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = o
c2 = r
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = r
c2 = l
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = l 
c2 = d


Then, after this is working 100%, you add code to determine if c1 and c2 are delims and print that out so your output will look like this:

TOP OF LOOP
c1 = h
is NOT a delim
c2 = e
is NOT a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = e
is NOT a delim
c2 = l
is NOT a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = l
is NOT a delim
c2 = l
is NOT a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = l
is NOT a delim
c2 = o
is NOT a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = o
is NOT a delim
c2 = 
IS a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = 
IS a delim
c2 = w
is NOT a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = w
is NOT a delim
c2 = o
is NOT a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = o
is NOT a delim
c2 = r
is NOT a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = r
is NOT a delim
c2 = l
is NOT a delim
TOP OF LOOP
c1 = l 
is NOT a delim
c2 = d
is NOT a delim
